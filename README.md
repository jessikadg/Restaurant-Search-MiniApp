# Restaurant-Search-MiniApp
Creation of miniapp to test useState, use Effect, API and other possibilities on React.

Restaurant Search Mini App created with React Native using Yelp API


In order to run this miniApp in your local machine, you will need to:
Create a YELP API account of your own
You can do so in this link: https://www.yelp.nl/fusion
(The App is set to Amsterdam, therefore used the .nl site)

Once logged in, check the documentation at https://www.yelp.nl/developers/v3/manage_app

And copy the API KEY and insert it in this application at /src/API/yelp.js

Then run expo or your simulator and the App is ready to go :)
